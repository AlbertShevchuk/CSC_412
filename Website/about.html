				<h3>Autobiography</h3>
				<p>
					Hardworking and a motivated man is how others describe me. College has been hard, regardless I persist. As an immigrant, I did not understand the American ways through high school and college and was often bullied for it. I suffered from an addiction to substances I used to escape reality. I had dreams I wanted to achieve that others would not support me in. My family shunned me for my addiction. They did not understand the cause of my problem. Instead, I became homeless. During my transition back home, I became aware that I had to pull myself up from my own boot straps. In my early twenties, I finally got serious about school. Creating programs has been my interest for a long time. My hobby since childhood has been assembling things on my own, whether physically or electronically. This is when the family roots of mechanics kicked in. I was always interested in fixing cars and shortly it became one of my good hobbies. To make my dreams come true, I found a support system that helped me get away from bad habits and into academics and social justice issues. By establishing this network, I have been able to experience more successes and pivoted my path into the right direction. I will be earning my BS in Computer Science, minor in Mathematics in two years. My past experiences have shaped me into who I am today. I am truly happy to be here at San Francisco State University. Working side by side with my cohort and challenging the world!
